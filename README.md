# webxgmidi
It's a WebMidi editor for Yamaha XG compatible synthesizers, as a single page web app (all styles and scripts are embedded in-page).
This is work in progress / proof of concept - a lot of the options are still missing.
If you want to add stuff, please follow my naming conventions.
There's a great XG parameter list over at http://www.studio4all.de/htmle/frameset091.html
