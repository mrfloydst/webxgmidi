# webxgmidi
It's a WebMidi editor for Yamaha XG compatible synthesizers, as a single page web app (all styles and scripts are embedded in-page).
This is work in progress / proof of concept - a lot of the options are still missing.
If you want to add stuff, please follow my naming conventions.
There's a great XG parameter list over at http://www.studio4all.de/htmle/frameset091.html

How to use:
Download the HTML file from the release https://github.com/mrfloydst/webxgmidi/releases/download/first/webxgmidi.html . 
Open that HTML file in a modern browser that supports WebMIDI (read: anything but Safari).
Confirm your browser is allowed to use MIDI.
You can use an external keyboard to play notes and send control data, this has a MIDI router built in.

I made this to have an interesting video on my YouTube channel, https://www.youtube.com/@mr_floydst  ;-)
